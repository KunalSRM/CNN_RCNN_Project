# Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN

This project is a Flask-based web application for **real-time object detection** using two models:
- **YOLOv5**
- **Faster R-CNN (PyTorch)**

You can dynamically switch between YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN during runtime via the web interface.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time webcam object detection.
- Supports switching between YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN models without restarting the server.
- Flask web interface to select the model.
- Live video streaming using Flask routes.
